# Minimal Railway config for Code-Sync railpack
# This file documents service build context and ports for convenience.
# Railway's exact TOML schema can vary; use this as a lightweight reference
# and the Railway CLI when linking/updating services.

# Paths are relative to this `railway.toml` file. The monorepo has `server` and
# `client` at the repo root, so reference them with `..` when this file lives
